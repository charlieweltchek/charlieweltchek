## About Me
Hello! I'm Charles Weltchek, a data-driven marketing and business strategist with a strong foundation in analytics, problem-solving, and project execution. With experience in marketing campaign management, business intelligence, and stakeholder collaboration, I specialize in translating data into actionable strategies that drive business success. I am looking for opportunities in strategy and transformation consulting, where I can apply data-driven insights and analytical problem-solving to help businesses optimize operations, improve decision-making, and drive growth.

My background includes marketing analytics, content strategy, and data visualization, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical insights and real-world business applications. I thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments, where I collaborate with teams to optimize marketing efforts, streamline business operations, and improve decision-making processes. When I'm not studying, you can find me either on the mountain skiing or out in the sun golfing.

Here you will find details on my education, work experiences, and skills. My Daniels Distinction Portfolio is also attached which includes a more detailed look at my Technical Skills & Certifications, my applications of Critical Thinking and Communication in real work settings, my Community Engagement, my Intercultural Competence, and my Resume.
